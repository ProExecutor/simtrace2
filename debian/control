Package: simtrace2-firmware
Section: devel
Architecture: all
Recommends: dfu-util
Description: Firmware for SAM3 based SIMtrace2 USB Devices.
 Open Source firmware for the Cortex-M3 microcontroller in the
 "Osmocom SIMtrace2" USB-attached peripheral device.  Will only work in
 SAM3S-based SIMtrace2, not in its SAM7S-based predecessor SIMtrace!
